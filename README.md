# Algorithm Note
This is my note recording my learning path about algorithm.
<br>It will contain some gread problems and my solution thought.
<br>You can think it is a report about solving problems.
<br>Almost programs will be achieved by C language. 

## 01.Greedy Algorithm
With the advice of my frient,I will learn greedy algorithm firstly.
<br> The major thought about greedy algorithm is that if it is the best choose,we shoult choose it immediately at that time.

* Moving Tables;from HDU 1050
<br> <tab> This problem is pretty easy.It can be solved by signing sections.
