# Algorithm Note
This is my note recording my learning path about algorithm.  
It will contain some gread problems and my solution thought.  
You can think it is a report about solving problems.  
Almost programs will be achieved by C language. 
If you find something is wrong,please send E-mail to me.Thank you!

01.Greedy Algorithm
----------------------
With the advice of my frient,I will learn greedy algorithm firstly.  
The major thought about greedy algorithm is that if it is the best choose,we shoult choose it immediately at that time.

* Moving Tables;from HDU 1050
    * This problem is pretty easy.Because it can be solved by signing sections.  
    * First,I will solve it by simply signing sections way.(At HDU1050.c file)
    * Seconed,I will solve it by greedy algorithm.(At HDU1050_G.c file)
* Tian Ji -- The Horse Racing
    * It's also a easy greedy algorithm.
    * And I solve it by sorting and comparing.
